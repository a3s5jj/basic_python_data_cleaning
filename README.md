🧹 Marketing Data Cleaning Project
📖 Overview

This project demonstrates how to clean, preprocess, and prepare marketing data for analysis using Python. It focuses on identifying common data quality issues, such as missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates, and transforming the dataset into a structured, analysis-ready form.

The notebook data_cleaning_using_python.ipynb documents each cleaning step in detail, and the resulting dataset is saved as cleaned_marketing_data.csv.

🧰 Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

pandas – for data manipulation

numpy – for numerical operations

matplotlib / seaborn – for simple data visualization

Google Colab – for running and downloading files
